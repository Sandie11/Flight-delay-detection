• Project title : Prediction of Flight Delays using Machine learning algorithms
• Goal:  To predict future delays in flights.
Abstract :  
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on flight arrival and departure timings data set..
Created data visualisations to understand the data in a better way.
Found strong relationships between independent features and dependent feature using correlation.

Handled missing values using strong correlations,dropping unnecessary ones and filling important features with mean values.
Used ensemble Modeling approach for building Classification Model to predict if flight will be delayed or not.
and finally concluded that Delays in departure of flights affects mostly to delay in flights.

Here, Logistic Regression model can predict 99.8% accurate results of flight delays
